This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.
'''

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a= "1"
b= "2"
c= a==b
print(c)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
x=5
y= 10
z= x==y
print(z)


#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
j= 15
k= 20
l= k>j
print(l)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
q= 35
r= 40
s= q<r
print(s)


#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
m= 30
n= 20
o= m>=n
print(o)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
g= 15
h= 20
i= g<=h
print(i)


#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

d= 15
e= 20
f= D>e
print(f)
