#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

#int 
a = 8

#float
a = 1.16

#string
a = "hello"

#boolean
a = True
a = False

#list
a = [10,9,8,7]

#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)
A = 4
a = 5


#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
varB = 10


varB = 15


#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:
varC = a


#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:
a = [4,5,6]

listVar = list[1]



#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first item
#in that list:
string = "ariam"

name = string[0]


#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print(varC)

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors

var=8
